        <p><strong>Fazliddin Mirzaev,</strong> according to google my name means kind, boutiful, graceful. I was born
            and raised in Russia but my ethnisity is Turkish. I lived in Turkey about 2 years before coming to United
            States. I went to JFK, then KMS, and then KFH. I am currently a senior in High school, I love everthing
            about this school, these include teachers, staff, and students. I want to become an entraprenuer, I gave
            myself some options to go to colledges, these include Ohio State University, Sinclar, University of Dayton,
            or Right State. This is my story.</p>
